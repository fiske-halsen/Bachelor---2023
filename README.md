### Introduction

This project was created to provide a solution for Ellab.

We have built a Multi-Language Text-To-Speech Notification System aimed to enhance Ellab's current notification system for alarm handling, specifically for EmSuite, their central monitoring system.

### About the Repository

This repository includes all the files and documentation necessary to understand our Multi-Language Text-To-Speech system. Please note that due to the proprietary and classified nature of certain aspects of this project, such as the hardware API and some components of EmSuite, we have used mock implementations in this public space.
