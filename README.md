### Introduction

This project was created to provide a solution for Ellab, a renowned company in the pharmaceutical and food industry, well known for its monitoring and validation solutions.

We've built a Multi-Language Text-To-Speech Notification System aimed to enhance Ellab's current notification system for alarm handling, specifically for EmSuite, their central monitoring system.

### About the Repository

This repository includes all the files and documentation necessary to understand, deploy, and utilize our Multi-Language Text-To-Speech system. Please note that due to the proprietary and classified nature of certain aspects of this project, such as the hardware API and some components of EmSuite, we've used mock implementations in this public space.
